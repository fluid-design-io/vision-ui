The Cursor Component is a custom, interactive cursor implementation using React and Framer Motion. It provides a dynamic cursor that responds to user interactions and changes appearance based on the elements it hovers over.

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "./components/core/cursor.tsx",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "tsx",
    "meta": "title=\"Cursor\""
  }
}
```

## Component Structure

The component is structured into two main parts:

1. `CursorInner`: The core functionality of the custom cursor.
2. `Cursor`: A wrapper component that checks if the device is touch-enabled and renders `CursorInner` accordingly.

The Cursor component will automatically handle hiding the default cursor and showing the custom cursor on non-touch devices.

## Performance Optimizations

- Use of Framer Motion's `frame` API to batch DOM reads, updates, and renders, preventing layout thrashing.
- Efficient event handling with checks to prevent unnecessary updates.
- Use of springs and motion values for smooth, hardware-accelerated animations.

## Usage

To use the Cursor component in your React application:

```jsx
import { Cursor } from "@/components/core/cursor";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your app content */}
      <Cursor />
    </div>
  );
}
```
