## Abstract

React and React Native codebases become hard to maintain when composition
patterns are present in the UI layer but not reflected in the file system.
Monolithic files, bag-of-exports modules, generic names, and route wrappers that
own feature orchestration all increase churn.

This guide defines four distinct rule areas:

1. shared component folders
2. route-bound feature folders
3. public API boundaries
4. naming stems and suffixes

Folder location (`components/` vs `features/`) is orthogonal to these rules.
A module under `components/` can own route-bound screens, and a module under
`features/` can expose a shared compound namespace. The rules describe file
shape, not folder location.

## 1. Component Folders

### 1.1 Use Compound Component Folders for Shared Multi-Part UI

Use a compound component folder when a shared component has:

- multiple named subparts consumers compose directly
- shared state needed by several sibling leaves
- variants that would otherwise turn into boolean props

Keep leaf components flat when they are small and presentational. Foldering is a
response to real complexity, not a default ceremony.

**Bad: one monolithic component plus sibling exports**

```text
components/
  Composer.tsx
  ComposerHeader.tsx
  ComposerFooter.tsx
  ComposerInput.tsx
  ComposerActions.tsx
  useComposerState.ts
```

Problems:

- the public API is a bag of related files
- shared state tends to leak through props or ad hoc hooks
- consumers must know too many implementation names

**Good: one folder with one public namespace**

```text
composer/
  composer.tsx
  composer.context.tsx
  composer.display.tsx
  composer.actions.tsx
  composer.types.ts
  index.ts
```

The folder mirrors the composition model:

- `composer.tsx` assembles the namespace
- `composer.context.tsx` owns state-sharing boundaries
- `composer.display.tsx` owns read-oriented leaves
- `composer.actions.tsx` owns interactive leaves
- `composer.types.ts` owns the context contract
- `index.ts` owns the public boundary

**Bad: UI coupled to one specific state hook**

```tsx
function ComposerInput() {
  const { input, setInput } = useChannelComposerState()
  return <TextInput value={input} onChangeText={setInput} />
}
```

This traps the UI inside one implementation.

**Good: provider-led state sharing through a stable contract**

```tsx
type ComposerState = {
  input: string
  attachments: Attachment[]
}

type ComposerActions = {
  updateInput: (value: string) => void
  submit: () => void
}

type ComposerMeta = {
  inputRef: React.RefObject<TextInput>
}

type ComposerContextValue = {
  state: ComposerState
  actions: ComposerActions
  meta: ComposerMeta
}
```

```tsx
const ComposerContext = createContext<ComposerContextValue | null>(null)

function ComposerProvider({
  children,
  value,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
  value: ComposerContextValue
}) {
  return <ComposerContext value={value}>{children}</ComposerContext>
}

function ComposerInput() {
  const {
    state,
    actions: { updateInput },
    meta: { inputRef },
  } = use(ComposerContext)

  return (
    <TextInput
      ref={inputRef}
      value={state.input}
      onChangeText={updateInput}
    />
  )
}
```

This is the important file-system implication:

- put the context contract in `composer.types.ts`
- put provider wiring in `composer.context.tsx`
- let display and action leaves consume the interface rather than own state

**Sharing state outside the visible frame**

State sharing is a provider concern, not a visual nesting concern.
Components outside the main frame can still read or mutate state if they live
inside the provider boundary.

```tsx
function ForwardMessageDialog() {
  return (
    <Composer.Provider value={value}>
      <Dialog>
        <Composer.Frame>
          <Composer.Input />
          <Composer.Footer>
            <Composer.Submit />
          </Composer.Footer>
        </Composer.Frame>

        <MessagePreview />
        <DialogActions>
          <ForwardButton />
        </DialogActions>
      </Dialog>
    </Composer.Provider>
  )
}
```

This is why context ownership belongs in the component-folder rule: it defines
how shared UI folders map composition and state sharing into files.

A module may own both a shared compound namespace and route-bound screens
when the shared surface genuinely belongs to the same domain. Keep the compound
namespace narrow (leaves only — no screens) and expose screens as top-level
exports per 2.1.

**Checklist**

- Is the component truly shared or multi-part?
- Are several leaves reading the same state?
- Would booleans or render props otherwise proliferate?
- Does the folder expose one root namespace?
- Is provider wiring isolated from leaf rendering?

## 2. Feature Module Folders

### 2.1 Use Feature Folders for Route-Bound UI

Use a feature folder when a page or screen owns real local complexity:

- route UI plus several internal leaves
- feature-specific query or mutation orchestration
- multiple related route surfaces
- nested subflows within one feature

Do not force small pages or screens into folders.

**Bad: feature logic scattered across unrelated globals**

```text
checkout.tsx
useCheckout.ts
CheckoutList.tsx
CheckoutSummary.tsx
types.ts
helpers.ts
```

Problems:

- the feature has no obvious home
- data logic drifts into generic hook folders
- route wrappers tend to accumulate orchestration

**Good: one feature folder with thin route wiring**

```text
checkout/
  checkout.tsx
  checkout.screen.tsx
  checkout.data.ts
  checkout.list.tsx
  checkout.summary.tsx
  checkout.types.ts
  index.ts
```

File ownership:

- `<feature>.tsx` assembles the public namespace when the feature exposes a
compound surface (2+ leaves, or 1 leaf plus shared state). A feature that
only exposes screens and a single leaf can skip `<feature>.tsx` and export
directly from `index.ts`.
- `checkout.screen.tsx` owns the main route-facing UI
- `checkout.data.ts` owns feature-local orchestration
- leaf files such as `checkout.list.tsx` and `checkout.summary.tsx` own
presentational sections
- `index.ts` owns the public boundary (feature root by default; top-level
screen exports when a feature has two or more route surfaces — see
**Multi-screen feature modules**)

**Bad: route file owns feature orchestration**

```tsx
export default function CheckoutRoute() {
  const { cart, isSubmitting, submitOrder } = useCheckout()

  return (
    <CheckoutLayout>
      <CheckoutList cart={cart} />
      <CheckoutSubmitButton
        loading={isSubmitting}
        onPress={submitOrder}
      />
    </CheckoutLayout>
  )
}
```

**Good: route wrapper stays thin**

```tsx
import { Checkout } from "@/features/checkout"

export default function CheckoutRoute() {
  return <Checkout.Screen />
}
```

If the router requires params, read them in the route file and pass them into
the feature surface. Keep the rest of the orchestration inside the feature.

**Multi-screen feature modules**

When a feature has two or more route surfaces, export each screen as a
top-level symbol from `index.ts` instead of namespacing them under the feature
root. Keep the feature namespace reserved for genuinely shared compound leaves
(for example `Faculty.Avatar`). A feature with exactly one screen may still use
`Feature.Screen` for symmetry.

```text
faculty/
  faculty.tsx                // Faculty = { Avatar }
  faculty.directory.screen.tsx
  faculty.detail.screen.tsx
  faculty.avatar.tsx
  faculty.data.ts
  index.ts
```

```ts
export { Faculty } from "./faculty"
export { FacultyDirectoryScreen } from "./faculty.directory.screen"
export { FacultyDetailScreen } from "./faculty.detail.screen"
```

The set of exports should map to the set of intentional public entry points —
one root is the default, not a hard cap.

**What belongs in `*.data.ts`**

Put feature-owned orchestration there:

- grouped view models
- screen-local queries and mutations
- filtering and search state
- adapters only this feature uses

Do not put generic API clients or widely shared hooks there.

When a subflow nests (5.1), subflow-only data moves into the subflow's
`*.data.ts`; see 5.2.

**Nested subflows**

When one feature contains distinct subflows, use nested folders only if they
represent real ownership.

```text
profile/
  profile.tsx
  profile.screen.tsx
  profile.data.ts
  security/
    profile-security.tsx
    profile-security.screen.tsx
    profile-security.data.ts
    index.ts
  preferences/
    profile-preferences.tsx
    profile-preferences.form.tsx
    index.ts
  index.ts
```

Create nested folders for real subflows, not symmetry.

**Checklist**

- Is a flat route file still enough?
- Does the feature have one obvious home?
- Is route wiring thin?
- Is feature-owned orchestration colocated in `*.data.ts`?
- Do nested folders represent real subflows?

## 3. Public API Boundaries

### 3.1 Export One Module Root by Default

For both shared components and feature folders, export one module root by
default. This keeps internal structure free to change without churn for
callers.

**Bad: export the entire inside of the folder**

```ts
export { CheckoutScreen } from "./checkout.screen"
export { CheckoutList } from "./checkout.list"
export { useCheckoutData } from "./checkout.data"
export { CheckoutSummary } from "./checkout.summary"
```

Problems:

- callers couple to internal layout
- every refactor becomes a breaking import change
- public API expands faster than the actual design intent

**Good: export only intentional public entry points**

```ts
export { Checkout } from "./checkout"
```

```ts
export { Faculty } from "./faculty"
export { FacultyDirectoryScreen } from "./faculty.directory.screen"
export { FacultyDetailScreen } from "./faculty.detail.screen"
```

The same rule applies to compound components:

```ts
export { Composer } from "./composer"
```

The rule is not "always exactly one export" — it is "exports match intentional
public entry points." One root is the default; screens become top-level
exports when a feature has two or more route surfaces (see 2.1).

Keep internal leaves internal unless they are intentionally designed as public
entrypoints.

**Reasonable exceptions**

Export additional symbols only when they are truly part of the public contract:

- a documented type meant for external consumers
- a route helper explicitly reused outside the module
- a test utility in a clearly separate testing boundary

If an exception exists, document it rather than letting the barrel grow
implicitly.

**Checklist**

- Does `index.ts` export only intentional public entry points (root by default,
plus top-level screens when 2.1 applies)?
- Are callers importing namespace surfaces instead of internal leaves?
- Are exceptions intentional and documented?

## 4. Naming Stems and Suffixes

### 4.1 Keep One Stem and Use Responsibility-Driven Suffixes

Naming should make ownership obvious before opening the file.

The default pattern in this skill is:

- one folder stem
- one repeated file stem
- one responsibility suffix per file

**Bad: mixed naming styles inside one folder**

```text
checkout/
  index.tsx
  useCheckout.ts
  CheckoutScreen.tsx
  helpers.ts
  types.ts
```

Problems:

- no consistent stem
- unclear ownership
- file purpose is hidden behind generic names

**Good: consistent stem plus explicit suffixes**

```text
checkout/
  checkout.tsx
  checkout.screen.tsx
  checkout.data.ts
  checkout.summary.tsx
  checkout.types.ts
  index.ts
```

**Per-folder reset**

The stem rule applies per folder boundary. A nested folder (see 5.1) resets the
stem to the folder's own name: `checkout/billing/billing.form.tsx` is correct;
`checkout/billing/checkout.billing.form.tsx` is not.

Useful suffixes:

- `.screen.tsx` for route-facing screen surfaces
- `.page.tsx` for page-oriented repos
- `.data.ts` for feature-owned orchestration
- `.types.ts` for shared types
- `.context.tsx` for provider wiring
- `.display.tsx` for read-oriented compound leaves
- `.actions.tsx` for interactive compound leaves
- `.utils.ts` for pure helpers
- `.constants.ts` for static configuration
- `.md` for scoped documentation

**Adaptation rule**

Do not force a second naming system onto a mature repo. If the repo already uses
PascalCase files or another coherent style, preserve that style and translate
the structure:

- keep one stem
- keep explicit responsibilities
- keep one public boundary

Consistency matters more than whether the repo chooses kebab-case or PascalCase.

**Checklist**

- Do all module-owned files share a stem?
- Does each suffix communicate one clear responsibility?
- Are generic names like `helpers.ts` or `stuff.ts` avoided?
- Is the repo's existing naming system being preserved when it is already coherent?

## 5. Organization Heuristics

These rules describe *when* to move between layouts the earlier sections
define. They are triggers, not new structures: apply them to decide when a flat
layout should nest and when colocated code should be lifted.

### 5.1 Nest Folders When Filename Prefixes Repeat

A flat module that started with two or three files eventually grows into a
dozen. Once multiple files share the same prefix, the prefix is no longer
distinguishing information — it is noise.

**Trigger:** three or more sibling files share the same leading stem (e.g.
`feature.detail.`*). Promote the shared prefix to a folder and give the folder
its own `index.ts`.

Keep a short sub-stem on files inside the new folder
(`detail/detail.header.tsx`, not `detail/header.tsx`). This preserves the one-
stem-per-module rule from section 4 and keeps search terms like `detail.header`
resolvable across the repo.

**Bad: flat layout with repeated prefixes**

```text
features/
  feature.detail.header.tsx
  feature.detail.list.tsx
  feature.detail.footer.tsx
  feature.detail.utils.ts
  feature.detail.data.ts
  feature.detail.types.ts
  feature.detail.index.ts
  feature.list.tsx
  feature.data.ts
  feature.types.ts
```

Problems:

- the `detail` prefix is repeated in every filename with no structural payoff
- `feature.detail.*` and `feature.*` interleave when sorted, hiding ownership
- there is no public boundary — every file looks equally importable
- the `detail` subtree cannot be moved or deleted as a unit

**Good: nest once the prefix repeats**

```text
features/
  feature/
    detail/
      detail.header.tsx
      detail.list.tsx
      detail.footer.tsx
      detail.utils.ts
      detail.data.ts
      detail.types.ts
      index.ts
    feature.list.tsx
    feature.data.ts
    feature.types.ts
    index.ts
```

The folder now carries the prefix. The files keep the sub-stem so intent stays
legible both inside and outside the folder. `index.ts` becomes the public
boundary (section 3.1) — internal leaves stay internal unless intentionally
exposed.

**Naming stays mechanical**


| File                           | Exports                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `composer/composer.input.tsx`  | `ComposerInput`        |
| `composer/composer.footer.tsx` | `ComposerFooter`       |
| `composer/index.ts`            | `Composer` (namespace) |


The path maps 1:1 to the component name so agents and humans never have to
guess where `Composer.Input` lives.

**When not to nest**

- the folder would contain only one or two files
- the shared prefix appears only twice and has no signs of growing
- nesting would be purely aesthetic (keep symmetry for symmetry's sake out)

**Barrel caveat**

Subfolders may have a local `index.ts` only when they represent a real subflow
with its own public surface consumed by parent siblings (the nested `detail/`
example above is such a case). Otherwise, imports inside the subfolder should
reference files directly (`./detail.header`), and the feature's root
`index.ts` remains the sole public boundary.

**Checklist**

- Do three or more sibling files share the same leading stem?
- Would promoting the stem to a folder collapse repetition without inventing
new names?
- Does the new folder expose only an intentional public surface via `index.ts`?
- Is the sub-stem preserved on files inside the folder?

### 5.2 Colocate Internals Until a Second Consumer Appears

Feature-owned helpers, data, and types belong next to the component that uses
them. Keep tests in a module-local `__test__/` folder instead of scattering
test files across the module root. Lifting code into a shared `lib/`,
`shared/`, or `utils/` location before a second consumer exists creates the
illusion of reuse and weakens ownership.

**Trigger:** a second consumer actually imports the helper. Until then,
colocate.

**Bad: extracted before a second consumer exists**

```text
src/
  lib/
    format-date.ts          // used only by feature.detail
    detail-utils.ts         // used only by feature.detail
  features/
    feature/
      detail/
        detail.header.tsx   // imports from ../../../lib/format-date
```

Problems:

- `lib/` advertises reuse that does not exist
- refactoring `detail` now requires edits in an unrelated directory
- later readers cannot tell what is genuinely shared from what was hoisted too
early

**Good: colocate until reuse is proven**

```text
src/
  features/
    feature/
      detail/
        detail.header.tsx
        detail.utils.ts     // format-date lives here
        detail.data.ts
        __test__/
          detail.header.test.tsx
        index.ts
```

When a second feature genuinely needs the helper, promote it then:

```text
src/
  lib/
    format-date.ts          // now genuinely shared
  features/
    feature/detail/...
    other-feature/...
```

**Rules of thumb**

- one consumer → colocate
- two consumers in the same feature tree → lift to the nearest common parent
- two or more consumers across unrelated feature trees → lift to `lib/` or
`shared/`
- when nesting a subflow folder (per 5.1), move data that is only consumed
inside the subflow into a colocated `*.data.ts`; data consumed by both the
root feature and the subflow stays in the feature-level `*.data.ts` until a
second consumer proves it should split
- tests live in `__test__/` within the same module
(`detail/__test__/detail.header.test.tsx`)
- types used only inside a folder stay in `*.types.ts` within that folder;
types crossing a folder boundary are exported via `index.ts`

**Why this pairs with the earlier rules**

Compound component folders (section 1.1) and feature folders (section 2.1) both
treat a folder as an ownership boundary. Colocation is the same idea applied to
non-component code: the folder owns its internals and `index.ts` decides what
leaks out. Together these rules make features **movable** — a folder can be
relocated or deleted as a unit without hunting for strays in shared
directories.

**Checklist**

- Does a second consumer actually exist before lifting the helper?
- Do helpers, data, and types live next to their consumer, with tests in
module-local `__test__/` folders?
- When code is lifted, is it lifted to the nearest real common ancestor?
- Is `lib/` or `shared/` reserved for code with genuine cross-feature reuse?
