# Vision UI

## What is Vision UI?

Vision UI is a collection of components that follow the VisionOS design language.

It uses most of the components from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the underlying components with others using [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/).

## Is this for production?

No, while the components are built with extreme attention to detail, it is not meant to be used in production.
Think of this as a playground for playing with VisionOS design language on the web.

However, you are more than welcome to use this for your own projects.

## How to use

This project assumes you already have `shadcn/ui` configured in your project.

Install `framer-motion` in your project.

```bash
npm install framer-motion
```

Then `copy/paste` the component you want to use into your project.
